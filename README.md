# Curtain-Navigation

So This is a basically a trial for me to create the curtain style effect for the navigation bar.
In most websites the navigation bar is on the top of the page or is brought down by clicking a button
but here i decided to spice things up and take the navigation bar down and it only reveals when you
click on the menu button present on the bottom center of the screen.
